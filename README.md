Statement of choice:
Social
In a post-COVID-19 world where face-to-face interaction is no longer the main mode of
communication, how would you revolutionize making new and/or maintaining relationships?


Our team has created a telegram bot to host strangers in a telegram room to play games together
How to use:
1) Search Random Games Bot on telegram
2) Use /start to begin using the bot
3) Use /join and a list of games will be presented to you
4) Choose one game and a link will be sent to you join the group for the game 
5) wait for other players to join then start the game

Aim of bot:
1) To create a space for people to meet with strangers online and play games together, while being able to chat at the same time
2) Also allows for groups of people to join at once and let them use the group created for them instead of having to deal with the bot in their own private group
3) If the user encounters someone they can clique with, they can then continue a private conversation on telegram between themselves


The current code is to simply add users into the group
Certain limitations with the current setup
1) There are no regulations to limit the number of people in the group, however the games provided will allow quite a number of people to play at once
2) It is also not possible to regulate the language used in the group, or any form of videos of photos sent so profanity cannot be controlled
3) Bots on telegram cannot regulate the group hence a person is required to be a moderator to either remove players or clear the chat regularly
